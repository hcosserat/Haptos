# Haptos

Haptos is a simple Android app that plays audio files with synchronized haptic feedback using `HapticGenerator`.

## Requirements

- Android 12 (API 31) or higher is required for haptic feedback support.
  - Devices running Android 11 or lower are **not supported**.
  - On Android 12+, support depends on your device and OS version.

## Notes

- Haptic feedback is not available when using Bluetooth or wired headphones.
- If haptic feedback does not work, ensure your device supports the required features and is running a compatible OS version.
